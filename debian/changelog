xdg-utils (1.0.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update debian/patches/xdg-email-generic:
    - Don't add things already added by upstream now.
    - Don't check if gnome-open/exo-open exists, because they almost
      certainly do if running under the corresponding desktop environment.
    - Remove upstream's default BROWSER list, sensible-browser will
      take care of it instead.
  * Update debian/patches/xdg-open-generic:
    - Don't check if gnome-open/exo-open exists, because they almost
      certainly do if running under the corresponding desktop environment.
      Check for kfmclient though, as the user might not have konqueror.
    - Decode file:/// URLs correctly before passing them to run-mailcap,
      expanding any percent-encoded characters.
  * Remove menu from Suggests. Was only ever used by xdg-su which does
    not exist anymore.
  * Switch to the new, cool debhelper v7. Rewrite debian/rules so it gets
    much smaller.
  * Remove the -1 revision from the quilt build-dep.
  * Add debian/patches/bashisms.patch, correcting some bashisms.
    Thanks to Chris Lamb for part of it. Closes: #472890.
