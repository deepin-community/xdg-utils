Description: Collected Debian patches for xdg-utils
Author: Nicholas Guriev <guriev-ns@ya.ru>

The xdg-utils package is maintained in Git rather than maintaining
patches as separate files, and separating the patches doesn't seem to
be worth the effort.  They are therefore all included in this single
Debian patch.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git
repository.
